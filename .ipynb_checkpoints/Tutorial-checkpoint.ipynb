    "This Python-package `petanalysis` contains 11 wrapper functions to get pet available data of the US. These functions process API [https://api.petfinder.com/v2/organizations?page=1](https://api.petfinder.com/v2/organizations?page=1e) to get data from shelter information and process API [https://api.petfinder.com/v2/animals?page=1](https://api.petfinder.com/v2/animals?page=1) to get the animal data. One function provide information for shelters and others provide information about animals. This package contains 8 internal functions, 2 for requesting API, 2 for data wrangling for shelter data, and 2 for data wrangling of animal data for association rules, and 2 for building plots which are not available to user. The list of 3 wrapper functions available to user is given below:\n",

    "1. get_shelter(postcode = None): help the user to narrow down the region\n",
    "2. assoc_rules(pets_data_df, min_supp, min_conf, sort_by_col, rule_cnt): provide initial analysis for user\n",
    "3. visualize(): present data in charts"
